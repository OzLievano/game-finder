Page object model, POM
design patter in test automation that creates an object repository for storing all elements
useful for reducing code duplication and improves test case maintenance
consider each web page of an application as a class file

register page

all these elements will be written within the register class page
seperate class for the login page
each and every screen are gonna be in seperate screens and call those
in our separate cases
